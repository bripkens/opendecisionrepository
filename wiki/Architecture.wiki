=Introduction=
This document describes the architectural decisions for the Open Decision Repository project. All decisions are documented according to the paper _VfAD_.

At the beginning of this document you can find a listing of all the architectural decisions that have been taken. Please notice that the order of these decisions has no meaning. At the end you will find a chronological- and dependency view the decisions.
