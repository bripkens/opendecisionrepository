=Introduction=
This document describes the Open Decision Repository (ODR) project, which is commissioned by the Software Engineering and Architecture group (SEARCH) of the University of Groningen. The goal of this project is to develop a freely available decision repository which allows to document architectural design decisions in software-intensive systems. This project will be realized as an internship project by two students from the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Venlo.  Also, no budget is available and the estimated time for the realization is set to 100 working days. 
Besides documentation the ODR should also provide three visualizations. These visualizations should use documented decisions, iterations and stakeholder information to illustrate certain parts of the documentation.




= Stakeholders =
Two groups of stakeholders can be identified. The first group are the customers. Customers are the originators of the project and among other things interested in the project progress. Software Engineers make up the second group. Potential users of the system like Software Architects could be represented as a third group. This group hasn't been included since the community of potential users is not aware of this product and has therefore no specific requirements or expectations for this project.

= Project Resources =

== Hardware requirements ==
It is necessary that both developers have a computer with internet connection. This working environment may be provided through the University of Groningen in case that a developer has no computer.





== Software requirements ==
A good practice is to use several (CASE-) tools in a software project like a version control system (VCS), a wiki and an issue tracker. The Google code platform offers these tools for free and has therefore been chosen. It also provides a nice connection between VCS and issue tracker that simplifies the process of working on issues.

Depart from these tools all other development tools are free of charge.




=Risk management =
Itâ€™s very important to spend some thought on project risks. This project will be realized by only two software engineers which means that probable risks have to be taken into account.


== Sickness ==
Since the team only consists of two members a serious sickness is dangerous. This risk can't be managed.


== Late requirement changes ==
Visualizations of architectural decisions are part of a paper by Uwe van Heesch and Paris Avgeriou. Since it is yet to be released requirement changes are likely to occur. Since we are using Scrum with a sprint duration of two weeks we can quickly react on these requirement changes.


== Wrong time estimation ==
Correct time estimation is difficult since both software engineers have limited knowledge regarding the problem domain and technologies. Managing this risk isn't easy, one solution is the development process. Scrum helps to improve time estimation since small work packages are chosen in every iteration. At the end of each sprint the retrospective allows to adapt the work load for the next sprint.


== Risk table ==
|| *Risk* || *Probability* || *Effect* ||
||Sickness||Moderate||Catastrophic||
||Late requirement changes||Likely||Serious||
||Wrong time estimation||Likely||Serious||


=Project schedule =
In this project Scrum will be used. Scrum is an agile project management method. The entire project time is divided into seven sprints and a four week analysis and design phase. One sprint takes two weeks. After every sprint, the customer will be informed about the project and gets a delivery. In the following figure you can see a detailed view about the schedule. The last sprint has a duration of three weeks as it will be focused on finishing the project and leaving it in a state that allows further development.
