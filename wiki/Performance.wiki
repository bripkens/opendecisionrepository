* changed amount of thread reuse to 10,000, i.e., uses the same HTTP worker thread for more than one request (simple: 211.1 req/sec and 194.6 kb/sec; complex: 65.0 req/sec and 1260.3 kb/sec)
* verified after application redeploy (to verify that no code was optimized by the JVM), same values as written above
