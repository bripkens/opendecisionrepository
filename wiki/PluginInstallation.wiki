#summary Installing the plugin on different OS'es

= Introduction =
Installing the plugin is quite simple. We provide an automatic installer which should work in most cases. However should this not succeed you can always install it manually.


= Automatic =
==Linux/OSX==
Installing for Linux and OSX is made easy using a shell script, if it does not work then please use the manual installation.
 * Download the following shell script from: [http://dl.decisionrepository.com/ dl.decisionrepository.com] our download mirror
 * Make it executable using _chmod +x odr-plugin-installer.sh_
 * Run it _./odr-plugin-installer.sh_

If it does not work, please make an issue in our issue tracker [ http://code.google.com/p/opendecisionrepository/issues/list Issue Tracker ]

And *clearly state which OS* you are using so that we can resolve the problem

==Windows==
Todo

=Manual=
Use the manual installation if the automatic one fails or if you prefer to do it manually.

 * Dowload the plugin .zip package from: [http://dl.decisionrepository.com/ dl.decisionrepository.com] 
 * Find your Visual Paradigm installation (C:\Program Files\Visual Paradigm, /opt/VP_Suite, /usr/local/VP_Suite) are just examples of locations where it might be installed.
 * Make a directory called plugins in the Visual Paradigm folder
 * Extract the zip package so that you have  Visual Paradigm/plugins/ODR
