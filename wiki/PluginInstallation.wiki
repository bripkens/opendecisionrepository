#summary Installing the plugin on different OSs
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />
= Introduction =
Installing the plug-in is quite simple. We provide an automatic installer which should work in most cases. However, should this not succeed you can always install it manually.


= Automatic installation =
==Linux/OSX==
Installing for Linux and OSX is made easy using a shell script, if it does not work, please use the manual installation guide (see the following section).
 * Download the following shell script from [http://dl.decisionrepository.com/ our download mirror].
 * Make it executable using _chmod +x odr-plugin-installer.sh_
 * Run it _./odr-plugin-installer.sh_

If it does not work, please add an issue to our [http://code.google.com/p/opendecisionrepository/issues/list issue tracker]. In order to resolve the problem, please state clearly which OS system you are using and the error you encountered.

==Windows==
For now please refer to the manual installation steps below.

=Manual=
Use the manual installation if the automatic one fails or if you prefer to do it manually.

 * Dowload the plug-in .zip package from [http://dl.decisionrepository.com/ our download mirror].
 * Find your Visual Paradigm installation, e.g., _C:\Program Files\Visual Paradigm, /opt/VP_Suite, /usr/local/VP_Suite_.
 * Make a directory called _plugins_ in the Visual Paradigm folder.
 * Extract the zip package so that you have _Visual Paradigm/plugins/ODR_.
