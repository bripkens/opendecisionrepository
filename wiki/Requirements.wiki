= Introduction =

== Purpose ==
The document describe the necessary requirments for the Open Decision Repository (ODR), which will be provide a visualization of the different architectural decisions and their relationships amongst themselves. The ODR is a project of the Software Engineering and Architecture Group (SEARCH) at the University of Groningen (RUG). The Originator is Mr. Uwe van Heesch. He is currently writing a paper about visualization of architectural decisions. This project serves as a prototyp which can also be used to support his paper. 

== Scope ==
 ####


== References ==
glossary, stakeholder document, bibliography

== Overview ==
We devided the different views about the requirments into to parts. The first part descibes the requirments in a rough way. This section is called high level. The second part is the low level view. In this section, the requirements are detailed.

== Product scope ==
The Open Decision Repository will provide the possibility to get a visualization about the decision within a project. It's a freely available repository to store all decisions within a project. It provides the functionallity to share the entire project with other members, who can get a insight of your decisions. 
You can also get three differehnt kind of views. 
 * A chronical view about the decisons and the members who take these
 * a stakeholder views, that describe the actions of every role
 * and a relationship view, that describe the dependencies of decisions.
Another very important point is the revision control, which enables jumping between differet versions of decions for reconstructe the whole project. 

There are four main parts in the project:
 * project management (e.g. create a project)
 * user management (e.g. create user with different roles)
 * decision visualization (e.g. get a chronical visualization)
 * administration (administrate the ODR)

== User characteristics ==
This project will be used by three different kinds of usergroups.

 * Guest
 The guest uses the system only to get a look into projects, which are pushlished. He can browse through the projects or find projects by using the search function. 

 * User
 The normal visitor of the system is a registrated user. He can create projects, can add  members and manage the entire project. Project members have to take a role within a project like "Software-architect", "manager" or "customer". Every role has different functionallity in the system that is adapeted to its scope of dutys. Furthermore he is able to get a look in all views (chronical view, stakeholder view and relationship view) of his projects and other published projects.

 * Administrator
 The administrator is able to manage the entities in the system. He can add common  entities or delete unesed entities.
