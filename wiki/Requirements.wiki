= Introduction =
This document adheres to [830-1998].

== Purpose ==
The document describes the requirements for the Open Decision Repository (hereinafter ODR). The ODR is a project of the Software Engineering and Architecture Group (SEARCH) at the University of Groningen (RUG). The originator is Mr. Uwe van Heesch. He is currently writing a paper about documentation and visualization of architectural design decisions together with Paris Avgeriou and Rich Hilliard. This project serves as a prototyp which may also be used to defend the paper.

Everybody who is interested in the intended functionality of the ODR may read this paper. This includes prospective developers and users.

== Scope ==
The Open Decision Repository will provide functionality to document and visualize decisions that have been made in a project. It's a freely available repository to store all decisions within a project. It provides functionallity to share the entire project with other members who can then get an insight into the decisions and the rationale behind them.
You can also get three different kinds of views. 
 * The *chronical view* visualizes the chronological order in which decisions were made, i.e. the temporal aspect of the documentation.
 * A *stakeholder-involvement view* which can be generated for each documented iteration. It shows all new decisions and changes to existing ones and the persons that were involved in this decision making process.
 * The last one is the *relationship view* which visualizes the relationships among all the decisions.
Another very important point is the revision control which enables switching between differet versions of decisions. Thus the history and progress of the project can be reconstructed.

There are four main parts in the project:
 * project management (e.g. create a project)
 * user management (e.g. create user with different roles)
 * decision management (e.g. document a decision)
 * decision visualization (e.g. get a chronical visualization)
 * administration (administrate the ODR)

== Overview ==
The following section provides an overall description about the ODR, followed by specific requirements in section three and views in section four.




= Overall description =

== Stakeholders ==
Please read the [http://code.google.com/p/opendecisionrepository/wiki/ProjectPlan#Stakeholders Project Plan] for more information about the stakeholders.

== Product perspective ==
The ODR aims to become a reference implementation of the viewpoints described in [VfAD]. In addition it should support the user by allowing him to
document software architecture in a simple and quick manner which as a result would allow him to spend more time on the actual design and implementation of the
business logic.

== Product functions ==
In section 1.2 (scope) four main functionality groups have been identified. The following figure shows them.
http://opendecisionrepository.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/packages.png

The requirements have been grouped according to this functionality groups.


== User characteristics ==
This project will be used by three different kinds of users.

 * Guest
The guest uses the system only to get a look into projects, which are pushlished. He can browse through the projects or find projects by using the search function. 

 * User
The normal visitor of the system is a registrated user. He can create projects, can add members and manage the entire project. Project members have to take a role within a project like "software-architect", "manager" or "customer". Furthermore he is able to get a look in all views (chronical view, stakeholder-involvement view and relationship view) of his projects and other published projects.

 * Administrator
The administrator is able to manage the entities in the system. He can add common entities or delete unused entities. 


== Constraints ==
The project is a non budget project therefore all technologies that will be used for the realization must be open source or at least free of charge.


== Assumptions and dependencies ==
None



= Specific requirements =
The requirements are documented in use case form. Some of these requirements contain the work flow for the creation or management of data. Italic text is used to visualize constraints, e.g. the maximum number of characters for an input field. When violated an error message is shown. It is possible to recover from such an error by undoing the previous action, e.g. clearing the input field.

= Non-functional requirements =

This section describes the non-functional requirements. Each of these non-functional requirements (NFR) has an id, as well as an assigned characteristic. These characteristics are the ones that are specified in [9126].
