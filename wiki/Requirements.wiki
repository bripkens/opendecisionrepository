= Introduction =
This document adheres to IEEE Std. 830-1998.

== Purpose ==
The document describes the requirements for the Open Decision Repository (hereinafter ODR). The ODR is a project of the Software Engineering and Architecture Group (SEARCH) at the University of Groningen (RUG). The originator is Mr. Uwe van Heesch. He is currently writing a paper about documentation and visualization of architectural decisions together with Paris Avgeriou and Rich Hilliard. This project serves as a prototyp which may also be used to defend the paper.

Everybody who is interested in the intended functionality of the ODR may read this paper. This includes prospective developers and users.

== Scope ==
The Open Decision Repository will provide functionality to document and visualize decisions that have been made in a project. It's a freely available repository to store all decisions within a project. It provides the functionallity to share the entire project with other members, who can get a insight into the decisions and the rationale behind them.
You can also get three different kinds of views. 
 * a chronical view about the decisons and the members who take these
 * a stakeholder involvement view, that describes the actions of every role
 * and a relationship view, that describe the dependencies of decisions.
Another very important point is the revision control, which enables switching between differet versions of decisions.

There are four main parts in the project:
 * project management (e.g. create a project)
 * user management (e.g. create user with different roles)
 * decision visualization (e.g. get a chronical visualization)
 * administration (administrate the ODR)


== Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ==
Please refer to the glossary and the project plan for acronyms, definitions and further information about the project structure.


== References ==
Please refer to the bibliography if you are interested in the information sources.

== Overview ==
The following section provides an overall description about the ODR, followed by specific requirements in section three and views in section four.




= Overall description =

== Stakeholders ==
Please read the [http://code.google.com/p/opendecisionrepository/wiki/ProjectPlan#Stakeholders Project Plan] for more information about the stakeholders.

== Product perspective ==
The ODR aims to become a reference implementation of the viewpoints described in _VfAD_. In addition it should support the user by allowing him to
document software architecture in a simple and quick manner which, as a result, would allow him to spend more time on the actual design and implementation of the
business logic.

== Product functions ==
In section 1.2 (scope), four main functionality groups have been identified. The following figure shows them.
http://opendecisionrepository.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/packages.png

The requirements have been grouped according to this functionality groups.


== User characteristics ==
This project will be used by three different kinds of users.

 * Guest
The guest uses the system only to get a look into projects, which are pushlished. He can browse through the projects or find projects by using the search function. 

 * User
The normal visitor of the system is a registrated user. He can create projects, can add  members and manage the entire project. Project members have to take a role within a project like "Software-architect", "manager" or "customer". Every role has different functionallity in the system that is adapeted to its scope of dutys. Furthermore he is able to get a look in all views (chronical view, stakeholder view and relationship view) of his projects and other published projects.

 * Administrator
The administrator is able to manage the entities in the system. He can add common  entities or delete unesed entities. 


== Constraints ==
The project is a non budget project, therefore all technologies that will be used for the realization must be open source or at least free of charge. Preferably, these technologies should be licensed under GPL v2.


== Assumptions and dependencies ==
None



= Specific requirements =
The requirements are documented in use case form. Some of these requirements contain the work flow for the creation or management of data. When italic text is used in a workflow, then it means that an error message is displayed if any of the previously mentioned constraints is violated. It is possible to recover from such an error by undoing the previous action, e.g. clearing the input field.

= Non-functional requirements =

This section describes the non-functional requirements. Each of these non-functional requirements (NFR) has an id, as well as an assigned characteristic. These characteristics are the ones that are specified in _ISO/IEC 9126-1:2001_.
