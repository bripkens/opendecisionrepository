= Overview =
The following component diagram provides an overview over the component which make up the Open Decision Repository server component, the plug-in and integration tests. A description of the components can be found in the following sections. A version of this diagram is also available in [http://opendecisionrepository.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/components.png higher resolution].

Components illustrated inside the OpenDecisionRepository component are not part of the server component. This may be the case for standalone applications, e.g., web-interface-test, integration-test, and for the plug-in.

All components listed here are realized using [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] and therefore this diagram can be reconstructed using the components' declared dependencies (see [http://maven.apache.org/pom.html Maven POM]).

= Component descriptions =

== testutil ===
As the name suggests, the testutil component contains utility classes for testing. Besides additional assertion statements, also database cleaning, i.e., truncating all tables, and functionality for dropping all tables exist.

== entities ===
The entities components contains JPA entities and other functionality, e.g., password encryption and email validation, which can easily be unit-tested. The component was solely created because, upon build, the decision-management component executes integration tests which take way longer.

== decision-management ===
Business logic is located in the decision-management component. It contains Enterprise JavaBeans which implement the [http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/DataAccessObject.html Data Access Object Pattern], TeX export functionality and a facade for accessing the [http://www.patternrepository.com/ Open Pattern Repository] web service. Additionally, it provides an extension point for other web services.
