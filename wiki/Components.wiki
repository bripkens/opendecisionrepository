== Overview ==
The following component diagram provides an overview over the component which make up the Open Decision Repository server component, the plug-in and integration tests. A description of the components can be found in the following sections. A version of this diagram is also available in [http://opendecisionrepository.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/relationship-view.png higher resolution].

Components illustrated inside the OpenDecisionRepository component are not part of the server component. This may be the case for standalone applications, e.g., web-interface-test, integration-test, and for the plug-in.

All components listed here are realized using [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] and therefore this diagram can be traced using the components' declared dependencies.
