= Deployment manual =

== Recommended set up ==
The following set up has been used for development, staging and production. Due to the early version of this project additional knowledge about the technologies may be required in order to get the system up and running.

 * Java 6
 * Glassfish 3.0.1
 * MySQL or Derby

== Build process ==
The ODR makes use of Apache Maven and is therefore simple to build. To get started with the current development version use a fresh checkout of the project (recommended) and execute the following commands.

{{{
# expected to be executed from the /trunk/sources folder
mvn clean
cd testutil
mvn install
cd ../entities
mvn install
cd ../decision-management
mvn install
cd ../web-interface
mvn install
cd ../odr-startup
mvn install
}}}

All this could be simplified to a `mvn clean install` from within the _/trunk/sources_ directory. Unfortunately this is not possible due to the current project structure, i.e. acceptance tests would automatically be run. [http://code.google.com/p/opendecisionrepository/issues/detail?id=55 Issue 55] has been created to cope with this problem.

=== Changing the context root ===
If you want to change the context root of the ODR from the default _/odr_ to something else you need to modify the following file:
/trunk/sources/odr-startup/src/main/application/META-INF/application.xml
