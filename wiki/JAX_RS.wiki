    <tr>
      <td> *Decision* </td>
      <td>JAX-RS has been adopted widely and a lot of documentation exists. Setting up a web service requires few lines of code but still provides a fair amount of flexibility, e.g., changing HTTP headers. For this reasons JAX-RS will be used.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> *Arguments* </td>
      <td>Since parts of the Java Enterprise Edition 6 are already used, it's useful to use more parts of it since they integrate well within the overall architecture. JAX-RS adds support for RESTful web services which fit very well into the overall target of a web service for a possible set of heterogeneous clients.</td>
